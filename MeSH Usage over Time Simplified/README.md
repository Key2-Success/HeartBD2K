## MeSH Usage over Time Simplified
This was a test project I was running on only 3 years of the data. The code returns the proportion of case reports that contain a given MH word (as inputted by user) over 3 years (both individually across the 3 years as well as a total across the 3 years). It finally outputs a histogram of the MH term's proportion, both across the 3 years individually as well as a total across the 3 years.
