## Merging by Impact Factors
This project was more difficult than it seems. I was assigned by a clinician to merge case reports by impact factors. However, the catch was that the case reports had journal names that were not consistent with the journal names in the impact factors file. A lot of string regular expression was used to help find common ground between the two lists. Alas, many journals were still not found, either because they were not on the list to begin with, they had a N/A impact factor, or, most likely, because its corresponding journal name was never determined.
