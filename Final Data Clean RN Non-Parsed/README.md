## Final Data Clean RN Non-Parsed

Similar to Final Data Clean RN Parsed, this code does the same functions but does not parse in RN terms by phrases; it parses by singular words (this was when I was naive to knowing how to parse in phrases). It also creates a corpus for text mining analysis and labels the case reports by gender. It also cleans the RN terms so that they are only separated by characters, versus other special characters.
