## **Correlation between DP and MH**

### **Background**
This was one of my first text-mining projects, so the majority of this project was exploring the text-mining packages and capabilities in R. Each case report has a DP (date of publication) as well as MH (MeSH term...MEdical Subject Headings). I wanted to specifically compare MeSH terms within the 3 years of 1978, 1980, and 1983 (these years were chosen arbitrarily and only for the reason to explore the text-mining packages, not to make exciting findings...if that were the case, I would have chosen three years much more apart from each other).

### **Content**
This project was primarily to understand the text-mining contents in R. I explored the major capabilities of all of the major text-mining packages in R. I have also included the sample dataframe I was working with.
