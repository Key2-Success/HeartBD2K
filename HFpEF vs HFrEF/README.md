# HFpEF vs HFrEF

In collaboration with a clinician, I was asked to determine whether there were any significant drug terms between HFpEF versus HFrEF, which are two pathways of heart failure (preserved ejection fraction versus reduced ejection fraction). The analysis was done through a 2 proportion z-test. However, because the chi square condition relating to expected cell count of at least 5 was not met, the test was not able to be run. The conclusion was to obtain a larger sample size to differentiate any significant drug terms across the two disease groups.

I was then asked to map all the case reports for both diseases to see if there were any insights on the regional distribution of HFpEF vs HFrEF case reports. I have attached two static maps relating to that.
