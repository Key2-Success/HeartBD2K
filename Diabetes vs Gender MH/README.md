## Diabetes vs Gender MH
This project looked into which MH terms are significant in diabetic males versus non-diabetic males as well as between diabetic females versus non-diabetic females. This project consisted of three steps: cleaning the case reports dataframe, using statistical analyses on the resulting dataframes, and creating correlation heat map outputs based on the results.
