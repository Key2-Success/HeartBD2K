# HeartBD2K
All of my projects from my data science research internship at the HeartBD2K lab at UCLA are contained here.

My two most notable projects to date at this internship have been R Shiny App as well as Geographic App, so I suggest you to check them out! The other projects are either side projects or code that led me to creating these two apps.
