## Final Data Clean RN Parsed
Similar to Final Data Clean MH Parsed, this code does the same functions but parses in RN terms by phrases, instead of singular words. It also creates a corpus for text mining analysis and labels the case reports by gender. It also cleans the RN terms so that they are only separated by characters, versus other special characters.
