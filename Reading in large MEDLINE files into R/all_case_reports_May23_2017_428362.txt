      due to potentially common pathogenic mechanisms. We report a severe form
      of pemphigoid gestationis in a 32-year-old primigravida woman, who presented
      at 22 weeks of gestation with headaches and blurred vision, later developing
      encephalitis, intrauterine fetal demise and dilated cardiomyopathy.

      congenital heart disease (CHD) 10 years earlier: closure of ostium primum,
      mitral annuloplasty, and aortic valve and root surgery. The patient was
      admitted with acute heart failure. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
      revealed a dysmorphic and severely incompetent aortic valve, a partial
      tear of the mitral valve cleft repair and annuloplasty ring dehiscence.
      A true left ventricular-to-right atrial shunt confirmed a direct Gerbode
      defect. The authors aim to discuss the diagnostic challenge of adult CHD,
      namely the key role of TEE on septal defects and valve regurgitations

      Functional Class IV Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.
PL  - United States

JID - 8111305
AB  - Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) occurs when pulmonary
      emboli fail to resolve with anticoagulation. For patients with inoperable
      or residual CTEPH, riociguat is currently the only therapy approved by
      the United States Food and Drug Administration. However, some patients
      with CTEPH may require therapy beyond riociguat, such as intravenous prostacyclins,
      which can present significant administration challenges in patients with
      complex comorbid conditions. We describe a 42-year-old man with T12 paraplegia
      complicated by CTEPH (functional class IV with substantial right ventricular
      dysfunction) and severe pressure ulcers. In order to facilitate goals
      of care (hospital discharge to a skilled nursing facility where parenteral
      prostanoids could not be administered), he underwent rapid transition
      from intravenous treprostinil to oral selexipag in the form of a cross-taper
      over 6 days. The patient required readmission due to worsening symptoms
      and was transitioned back to intravenous treprostinil; he tolerated conversion
      to oral treprostinil for approximately 4 months, but it was subsequently
      discontinued due to nausea and modified goals of care. The patient eventually
      succumbed to clinical deterioration after transition to hospice care 3
      months later. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe transition
      from intravenous treprostinil to selexipag as well as conversion from
      parenteral treprostinil to oral treprostinil in a patient with CTEPH and
      illustrates the approaches to and potential issues with prostanoid transitions.
      Additional observations are necessary to better understand the relative
      roles of selexipag and oral treprostinil regarding comparative efficacy
      and tolerability. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

      and macrophages expected in acute cellular rejection but also of eosinophils,
      B-lymphocytes, and plasma cells indicating myocarditis.

AB  - Cavernous angiomas are central nervous system malformations. Most common
      manifestations are seizures and acute focal neurological deficits. We
      present a case report of a seventy-one year-old man with a two-month history
      of behavior changes, attention deficit and indifference followed by gait
      unsteadiness. Neuropsychological evaluation showed severe cognitive impairment
      and executive dysfunction. Head computed tomography depicted a supraventricular
      hydrocephaly. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small hemorrhage,
      contiguous to a mesencephalic cavernous angioma, obstructing the Sylvius
      aqueduct, causing secondary hydrocephalus. Four months after endoscopic
      ventriculocisternostomy, neuropsychological evaluation showed improvement
      and the patient regained autonomy. Parenchyma cavernous angiomas causing
      direct hemorrhage and subsequent obstruction of the Sylvian aqueduct are
      uncommon. Sub-acute behavior and mental state abnormalities are rare first
      manifestations of cavernous angioma and requires high clinical suspicion
      for its correct diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation is crucial
      in the detection of such patients as prompt neurosurgical intervention
      may substantially improve cognitive function.

      to the neurosurgical team. Various techniques such as adenosine-induced
      hypotension, rapid ventricular pacing, and inducing deep hypothermia are
      described in the literature to effect circulatory arrest for the successful
      obliteration of giant aneurysms. We describe a novel technique of induced
      hypotension for clipping a giant aneurysm by using an inflatable balloon
      across the main pulmonary artery with a successful outcome. This technique
      has not been described earlier in the literature.

      Diagnostic imaging led to the diagnosis of bilateral extensive pulmonary
      emboli extending into all segmental branches. Tissue plasminogen activator
      (tPA) was administered via 2 separate EKOS catheters. Repeat evaluation
      after 33 hours revealed improvement of right ventricular size and function.
      EKOS catheters are useful for administration of fibrinolytics in pulmonary

AB  - A case of 60-year-old male with acute pulmonary embolism without hypotension
      but signs of right ventricular dysfunction and elevated cardiac biomarkers
      is reported in this study. The patient comes under intermediate high-risk
      category and was successfully thrombolysed with alteplase infused through
      pulmonary artery catheter. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can be
      considered as much safer and effective alternative to systemic thrombolysis
      in such patients with lower risk of bleeding. This novel bedside method
      of pulmonary artery CDT with the advantage of no radiation exposure and
      real time monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures as an end-point of
      thrombolysis can be utilized in the near future.

PL  - United States
TA  - Catheter Cardiovasc Interv
JID - 100884139
AB  - We report a case of the successful use of a central arteriovenous (cAV)
      coupler device to treat severe drug-resistant primary hypertension in
      a 46-year-old female. The device is inserted via a femoral approach to
      create an ateriovenous fistula between the external iliac artery and vein
      and has shown promise in the treatment of severe hypertension. The patient's
      24-hr ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) pre device insertion on eleven anti-hypertensive
      medications revealed a mean 24-hr ABP of 165/98 mm Hg. The insertion of
      the cAV coupler resulted in a sustained anti-hypertensive effect nine
      months post-procedure, with mean 24-hr ABP of 154/91 mm Hg on only two
      anti-hypertensives. Her significant anti-hypertensive response may be
      explained by the presence of an inelastic aortic graft that had been inserted
      due to prior aortic dissection as it allowed the restoration of elasticity
      in a previously inelastic arterial system. We believe that the ROX cAV
      coupler device warrants further investigation. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals,

AB  - Differentiation of a wide complex arrhythmia can pose as a clinical challenge
      in the acute care setting. Two broad differentials exist including ventricular
      tachycardia versus supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, underlying
      bundle branch block or intrinsic conduction defect. To aid in distinguishing
      between supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia, Brugada
      criteria is commonly used, albeit new algorithms have become more common.
      Marriott's sign, a taller peak in the first R wave when compared to R'
      is considered a specific criterion for distinguishing between these two
      entities and strongly favors the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia.
      In this case we present a wide complex tachycardia, which is an exception
      to Marriott's sign.

TA  - Korean J Gastroenterol
JID - 101189416
AB  - Intramural hematoma of the esophagus is a rare condition that can be spontaneous
      or secondary to trauma, toxic ingestion, or intervention. If it is the
      spontaneous type, it usually presents initially with epigastric pain,
      hematemesis or dysphagia. We present a case of intramural hematoma of
      the esophagus mimicking acute coronary syndrome. A 63-year-old man presented
      with severe acute chest pain. He has four coronary stents that were inserted
      five years ago, from a different hospital, and is on dual antiplatelet
      agents. Coronary angiography was performed immediately under the suspicion
      of acute coronary syndrome, and we found that there was no obvious clogging
      of the coronary arteries. Next, chest computed tomography was performed
      due to suspected aortic dissection, and the result was also negative.
      Four days later, endoscopy was performed and intramural hematoma covered
      with large ulcers was diagnosed.

TI  - The role of echocardiography in fetal tachyarrhythmia diagnosis. A burden
      for the pediatric cardiologist and a review of the literature.
PL  - Romania

JID - 101522985
AB  - Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia represents the most frequent fetal dysrhythmia.
      In the lack of diagnosis and treatment these fetuses may develop hydrops
      and even death. For the therapeutic approach it is important to establish
      the diagnosis of the type of supraventricular tachycardia. In this paper
      we report 29 cases with different types of supraventricular tachycardia
      in which the diagnosis was established using our own protocol, which allowed
      us to make the difference between the types of tachycardia (atrioventricular
      reentry tachycardia due to the accessory pathway, atrial ectopic tachycardia
      and permanent junctional reciprocal tachycardia). We acquired the data
      by a series of recordings in M mode and pulsed Doppler by simultaneous
      recording of an artery and a vein flow. First of all, we diagnosed the
      supraventricular tachycardia type, with short or long ventriculoarterial
      interval, and afterwards, we made the difference between atrial ectopic
      tachycardia and permanent junctional reciprocal tachycardia using methods
      to decrease the atrioventricular conduction.

      A case report.

JID - 9612761
AB  - Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP) can cause severe secondary post-partum
      hemorrhage. The lag time between the triggering event and the manifestation
      of UAP reportedly usually occurs within a couple of weeks. In this case
      report, a 46-year-old woman with no significant comorbidities presented
      with a one-month history of increasing lower abdominal pain. She had previously
      undergone two cesarean sections (14 and 10 years earlier). A computed
      tomography angiogram revealed a left UAP. The patient was successfully
      treated by selective embolization and had an uneventful recovery. In our
      case, the time period between the cesarean section and presentation was
      approximately 10 years with no other potential causative factors. This
      case highlights that UAP should be included as a differential diagnosis
      in all female patients presenting with pelvic pain and pelvic bleeding.
      More specifically, UAP should be considered after a previous history of
      cesarean section, as a delayed diagnosis can result in serious morbidity
      and even mortality.

AB  - Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is thought to be a risk factor for decompression
      illness (DCI). Catheter-based closure procedure reduces the risk of DCI
      in selected scuba divers with PFO. Major complication of invasive approach
      are rare, minor, especially heart rhythm disturbances are reported relatively
      often. We describe a case of 41-year-old diver, who underwent PFO closure
      due to recurrent DCI events. Afterward, he experienced no DCI symptoms;
      however, he complained about feeling of the heart beating during a submersion.
      Arrhythmia should be considered as a life-threatening for scuba diver,
      thus we performed underwater ECG monitoring and exclude the arrhythmia.

PL  - United States

JID - 0375370
AB  - Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a rare, but life-threatening
      medical phenomenon. MVT is normally characterized by insidious onset,
      with nonspecific signs and symptoms. A high index of clinical suspicion
      is required for diagnosis, and emergency surgery is necessary to optimize
      the chances of patient survival, especially in the people aged more than
      70 years. Surprisingly, based on my review of the literature, no fatal
      acute MVT case has been reported in the forensic literature. All reported
      such cases have been documented in medical literature, and most of them
      have been associated with underlying risk factors for venous thrombosis,
      such as hypercoagulable state, certain cancers, and stasis of the blood
      flow. Here, I report the case of a sudden unexpected death due to extensive
      intestinal ischemia and infarction with massive abdominal hemorrhage caused
      by acute MVT in a 72-year-old man without known underlying risk factors.

TI  - The Novel Use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta
      to Explore a Retroperitoneal Hematoma in a Hemodynamically Unstable Patient.
PL  - United States
TA  - Am Surg
JID - 0370522
AB  - Balloon occlusion of the aorta was first described by C.W. Hughes in 1954,
      when it was used as a tamponade device for three wounded soldiers during
      the Korean War suffering from intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Currently, the
      device is indicated in trauma patients as a surrogate for resuscitative
      thoracotomy. Brenner et al. reported a case series describing the use
      of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) in
      advanced hemorrhagic shock. Their conclusion was that "it is a feasible
      method for proximal aortic control." We describe the novel use of REBOA
      before retroperitoneal hematoma exploration in a hemodynamically unstable
      patient. Reported is a 19-year-old blunt trauma victim where REBOA was
      successfully deployed as a means for proximal arterial control before
      a Zone 1 retroperitoneal hematoma exploration. The source of the patient's
      hemorrhagic shock was multifactorial: grade V hepatic injury, retrohepatic
      inferior vena cava laceration, and right renal vein avulsion with Zone
      1 retroperitoneal hematoma. Immediate return of perfusion pressure, as
      systolic pressures increased from 50 to 150 mm Hg. Hemodynamic improvements
      were accompanied by decreased transfusion and vasopressor requirements.
      In addition, the surgeons were able to enter the retroperitoneal hematoma
      under controlled conditions. REBOA is an attractive new tool to gain proximal
      aortic control in select patients with hemorrhagic shock. It is less morbid,
      possibly more efficient, and appears to be more effective than resuscitative
      thoracotomy. REBOA is certainly feasible for proximal aortic control before
      retroperitoneal exploration, and should be considered in select patients.

PL  - United States
TA  - Neuroradiol J
JID - 101295103
AB  - Isolated aneurysms of spinal arteries are rare. Spinal artery aneurysms
      are commonly found in association with spinal cord arteriovenous malformation
      and coarctation of aorta and rarely with aortic arch interruption and
      Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Spinal angiograms are the gold standard for
      diagnosing these spinal artery aneurysms but with the advances in computed
      tomography technology these aneurysms can also be very well demonstrated
      in computed tomography angiograms. We describe three cases of anterior
      spinal artery aneurysm, those are flow related aneurysms, associated with
      coarctation of aorta and with Takayasu arteritis.

PL  - United States
TA  - Neuroradiol J
JID - 101295103
AB  - Congenital agenesis of the internal carotid artery is a very rare anomaly.
      Intracranial circulation in the involved internal carotid artery territory
      is maintained by collateral circulation from the contralateral internal
      carotid artery through the anterior communicating artery and from the
      vertebrobasilar system through the posterior communicating artery. Usually,
      patients with internal carotid artery agenesis are asymptomatic due to
      collateral circulation, but they may present with headache, seizures,
      or transient ischemic attack. Aneurysms have also been reported to be
      associated with this entity. Computed tomography angiography, magnetic
      resonance angiography, and digital subtraction angiography are commonly
      used modalities to make the diagnosis. Unenhanced skull base computed
      tomography will show the absence of carotid canal, thus differentiating
      from carotid hypoplasia. We report on a case of right internal carotid
      artery agenesis with discussion of embryogenesis, clinical presentation,
      and imaging findings.

      Three case reports and literature review.
PL  - United States
TA  - Neuroradiol J
JID - 101295103
AB  - Background and importance Intraorbital arteriovenous fistulas (IOAVFs)
      are rare and cause eye redness, exophthalmos, blurry vision and bruit.
      Whereas in the past they were treated conservatively, surgically or transarterially,
      recent developments in transvenous embolization have improved their treatment.
      In this paper the authors report three cases of IOAVFs treated endovascularly
      and review the evolution of treatment options. Methods Three cases of
      purely IOAVF enrolled in our center were reported and a PubMed literature
      search was performed using "pure intraorbital arteriovenous fistula" and
      "arteriovenous fistula of the optic nerve sheath." A total of 21 papers
      were reviewed in full, focusing primarily on the treatment and outcomes.
      Results A total of 26 patients were obtained, including our three patients
      and 23 patients reported in the literature. In nine patients treated conservatively,
      four spontaneous occlusions, one visual deterioration and four cases with
      unknown outcome were reported. In another 18 patients, 29 therapies (including
      five surgical treatment, 11 transarterial embolizations and 13 transvenous
      embolizations) were attempted and resulted in 12 cures, five visual deteriorations
      and one without reported outcome. More recently, transvenous embolization
      has become the mainstay of IOAVF treatment. Of the 21 patients assessed
      between 2000 and 2013, a transvenous approach was attempted in 13 patients;
      nine patients were cured without any adverse events. Conclusion Development
      and improvement of transvenous techniques are found to be safe and effective
      for patients with IOAVF.

AB  - Advent of antiretroviral therapy has increased survival of patients with
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, with the result that some
      of these patients now develop degenerative diseases, such as atherosclerotic
      aneurysms. Degenerative thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm is rare in HIV
      patients. In this report, a 63-year-old male patient with HIV submitted
      to open repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient did not
      suffer any type of complication in the perioperative period and remained
      well in a 28-month follow-up period. In summary, open repair still remains
      a good alternative for aortic complex aneurysms even in HIV patients.

JID - 2985248R
AB  - RATIONALE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which
      diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and radiological features, is
      a neurotoxic disease characterized by a set of clinical manifestations,
      such as seizure, headache, visual, and/or consciousness disturbance. It
      is the first case of PRES followed by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) without
      underlying disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 37-year-old healthy woman had
      PPH after caesarean section. Six days after delivery, headache occurred
      suddenly, followed by episodes of clonus seizure. DIAGNOSES: Brain computed
      tomography showed ischemic stroke. However, magnetic resonance imaging
      revealed characteristics consistent with PRES. INTERVENTIONS: The patient
      received phenytoin for seizure control. OUTCOMES: Seizure was under good
      control over the following days. Three months later, repeated magnetic
      resonance imaging showed complete remission. LESSONS: PRES may be triggered
      by PPH and is not necessarily secondary to typical predisposing factors
      such as hypertension or pre/eclampsia. Hormone fluctuation, increased
      blood pressure variation, and massive blood transfusion may be contributed
      to the development of PRES in our case. Also, it is necessary to rule
      out those life-threatening diseases, such as cavernoma hemorrhage, cerebral
      venous thrombosis, and ischemic stroke before the diagnosis of PRES.

      multiple anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms: A case report.
PL  - United States
TA  - Medicine (Baltimore)
JID - 2985248R
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clipping of multiple intracranial aneurysms in 1 stage
      is uncommon. In this case, we report clipping of an ophthalmic aneurysm
      associated with multiple anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms
      via the Dolenc approach. METHODS: The main symptoms of the patient are
      headache, along with nausea and vomiting. The patient's arteriogram revealed
      a wide-necked aneurysm of the right ophthalmic artery, an irregular aneurysm
      of the anterior communicating artery, and a basilar artery aneurysm. The
      surgical intervention for these aneurysms is a challenge because of the
      complex anatomical relationship with the surrounding structures. The 3
      aneurysms, which were not amenable to a single intervention, were successfully
      clipped in 1 incision. RESULTS: After surgery, the patient reported feeling
      well. One year after surgery, the patient had no SAH recurrence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Occasionally, surgical treatment was used even for aneurysms of the carotid-ophthalmic
      artery with aneurysms of anterior communicating artery and basilar artery,
      which are contraindicated for interventional therapy.

TA  - Medicine (Baltimore)
JID - 2985248R
AB  - RATIONALE: Crystalglobulinemia is a rare disease caused by monoclonal
      immunoglobulins, characterized by irreversible crystallization on refrigeration.
      It causes systemic symptoms including purpura, arthralgia, and vessel
      occlusive conditions to be exacerbated by exposure to cold. We report
      a patient with crystalglobulinemia associated with monoclonal gammopathy
      of undetermined significance (MGUS) manifesting as chronic arthralgia
      and recurrent acute arterial occlusion. PRESENTING CONCERNS: A 61-year-old
      man, who had been diagnosed with MGUS and who had arthralgia of unknown
      origin, presented with recurrent acute limb ischemia after surgical thromboembolectomy.
      Refrigeration of his serum formed precipitates that looked like needle-shaped
      crystals. These crystals did not dissolve with warming, which is not a
      characteristic of cryoglobulins. Skin biopsy results showed crystal-liked
      eosinophilic bodies in small vessels and we diagnosed crystalglobulinemia.
      INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: Although he underwent above-knee amputation,
      he was treated with a bortezomib and dexamethasone-based chemotherapeutic
      regimen, following lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Finally, he achieved
      complete remission and serum crystalglobulins diminished. LESSONS: Monoclonal
      gammopathy, previously diagnosed as MGUS, can cause systemic symptoms
      and thrombotic conditions by producing pathologic immunoglobulins, such
      as crystalglobulins. In such situations, MGUS, even when it has not progressed
      to multiple myeloma, can be a target of aggressive chemotherapy. Crystalglobulinemia
      should be considered for patients with monoclonal gammopathy manifesting
      as systemic and thrombotic symptoms exacerbated by cooling.

TI  - The role of renoscintigraphy and surgery in the management of Page kidney:
      A case report.
PL  - United States
TA  - Medicine (Baltimore)
JID - 2985248R
AB  - RATIONALE: Page kidney is an uncommon condition that hypertension occurs
      secondary to microvascular ischemia and alternation of small-vessel hemodynamics
      due to external compression of renal parenchyma and activation of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. There are no specific guidelines
      for the management of Page kidney in the literatures. PATIENT CONCERNS:
      A 17-year-old teenager who had Fontan procedure for tricuspid and pulmonary
      atresia in early childhood suffered from sudden onset of severe left flank
      pain during cardiac catheterization procedure. Left renal artery active
      bleeding with renal parenchyma compression in association with renin-mediated
      hypertension led to the diagnosis of Page kidney. DIAGNOSES: Page kidney
      was diagnosed in this case. INTERVENTIONS: Urgent embolization was performed
      to treat left renal artery active bleeding. Because of decreased renal
      function with elevation of serum creatinine, inadequate blood pressure
      control with antihypertensive medication, and poor renal blood flow of
      left kidney, open drainage of perirenal hematoma was done 5 days after
      catheterization procedure. OUTCOMES: After the operation, glomerular filtration
      rate improved immediately, and left flank pain and hypertension resolved
      at discharge. LESSONS: The choice of the therapies for Page kidney depended
      on the clinical presentation of each case. This case pointed out the significance
      of renoscintigraphy and surgery in the management of Page kidney.

      recurred as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the left atrium.
PL  - United States
TA  - Medicine (Baltimore)
JID - 2985248R
AB  - RATIONALE: An intracardiac cystic mass is a rare type of mass found in
      the left atrium. The differential diagnosis of an intracardiac cystic
      mass includes hydatid cysts, bronchogenic cysts, intracardiac varices,
      and hemorrhages in some tumor types, including myxoma. PATIENT CONCERNS:
      We present the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with episodic
      dyspnea. DIAGNOSES-INTERVENTIONS-OUTCOMES: Transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE) revealed the presence of a left atrial mass mimicking myxoma. However,
      in postoperative findings, it was determined that the mass was actually
      a hemorrhagic cyst. Eighteen months later, the patient presented with
      recurrent exertional dyspnea and TTE revealed the recurrence of a left
      atrial mass. Computed tomography showed that the mass extended into the
      right atrium, inferior vena cava, and coronary sinus. After re-operation,
      the final histological diagnosis was determined to be an undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma in the left atrium. LESSONS: An intracardiac hemorrhagic
      cyst was suspected during the operation of a benign-looking LA mass. As
      such, we recommend that other rare etiologies be considered and more biopsies
      be performed when possible.

AB  - Acute pancreatitis is potentially fatal and in its severe form is often
      associated with pancreatic necrosis and higher mortality. The inflammatory
      response causes peripancreatic and pancreatic necrosis, and in severe
      cases results in multiple organ damage through vascular insult either
      in form of arterial spasm, arterial thrombosis or splanchnic thrombosis
      [1].

AB  - The authors report a 9-year follow-up of macular complications in a 66-year-old
      woman affected with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Rarely, clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy are presented in a patient
      with retinal dystrophy. This patient developed a bilateral diabetic macular
      edema (DME), which made its management complex due to the multiple pathogenic
      processes involved. Despite the chronicity of the DME, visual acuity remained
      stable without therapy. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report
      of DME in RP with such a long follow-up. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging
      Retina. 2017;48:340-344.].

AB  - Fungal endocarditis (FE) is commonly regarded as a rare but fatal disease.
      The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) in hemodialysis (HD) patients
      is thought to be obviously higher than that in the general population.
      Moreover, IE occurs more likely in HD patients with catheters. With the
      increase of HD population and extensive use of catheters in HD patients,
      FE, as a special form of IE, may increase and bring new challenges to
      clinicians. We reported a case of FE associated with catheter infection
      in a 44-year-old woman on HD. The risk factors and treatment strategies
      of FE in HD patients were discussed.

TI  - Analytical Criticalities Associated to Different Immunological Methods
      for Serum Free Light Chain Detection in Plasma Cell Dyscrasias: A Description
      of Particular Clinical Cases.
PL  - Switzerland
TA  - Int J Mol Sci
JID - 101092791
AB  - Current criteria for differential diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM),
      Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and smoldering
      multiple myeloma (SMM) are included in the 2003 guidelines by the International
      Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). An updated version was then published in
      2014, highlighting the importance of serum free light chain (sFLC) detection,
      as well as the kappa/lambda ratio as excellent indicators of clonality.
      At present, two commercial assays for sFLC quantification are available:
      the Freelite assay and the N-Latex assay. The first was developed by The
      Binding Site based on a mixture of polyclonal antibodies directed against
      a variety of FLC epitopes. It may be run on a wide range of nephelometers,
      as well as on turbidimeters. The second method was developed by Siemens
      and runs exclusively on Siemens instruments. It employs a probe mixture
      of mouse monoclonal antibodies. The aim of our study was to evaluate sFLC
      measurement and calculated kappa/lambda ratio in 85 patients with monoclonal
      gammopathies (MGs) in order to compare methods. We demonstrated that there
      is only a moderate concordance between the two FLC assays. In particular,
      in one case, we observed no qualitative alterations of the serum protein
      pattern, and in the absence of a Freelite assay, sFLC measurement would
      not have been possible to highlight the increase of lambda FLC.

AB  - Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a recognized complication
      of transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement in previous surgical
      prostheses. We describe a patient who was high risk for repeat open surgery
      in whom the LVOT was compromised by a surgical strut and the potential
      for LVOT obstruction. A novel approach to avoiding this complication was
      utilized. A perfusion balloon was inflated in the outflow tract to provide
      an opposing force during mitral valve deployment resulting in less flaring
      of the strut into the outflow tract thereby improving the neo-LVOT area.
      No outflow tract obstruction occurred. The advantages of this approach
      as well as other alternative solutions to this problem are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The widely used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin increases
      risk of cardiovascular and sudden cardiac death, although the underlying
      mechanisms are unclear. Case reports, including the one we document here,
      demonstrate that azithromycin can cause rapid, polymorphic ventricular
      tachycardia in the absence of QT prolongation, indicating a novel proarrhythmic
      syndrome. We investigated the electrophysiological effects of azithromycin
      in vivo and in vitro using mice, cardiomyocytes, and human ion channels
      heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and Chinese
      hamster ovary (CHO) cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In conscious telemetered
      mice, acute intraperitoneal and oral administration of azithromycin caused
      effects consistent with multi-ion channel block, with significant sinus
      slowing and increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, as seen with azithromycin
      overdose. Similarly, in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, the drug slowed sinus automaticity,
      reduced phase 0 upstroke slope, and prolonged action potential duration.
      Acute exposure to azithromycin reduced peak SCN5A currents in HEK cells
      (IC50=110+/-3 mumol/L) and Na+ current in mouse ventricular myocytes.
      However, with chronic (24 hour) exposure, azithromycin caused a approximately
      2-fold increase in both peak and late SCN5A currents, with findings confirmed
      for INa in cardiomyocytes. Mild block occurred for K+ currents representing
      IKr (CHO cells expressing hERG; IC50=219+/-21 mumol/L) and IKs (CHO cells
      expressing KCNQ1+KCNE1; IC50=184+/-12 mumol/L), whereas azithromycin suppressed
      L-type Ca++ currents (rabbit ventricular myocytes, IC50=66.5+/-4 mumol/L)
      and IK1 (HEK cells expressing Kir2.1, IC50=44+/-3 mumol/L). CONCLUSIONS:
      Chronic exposure to azithromycin increases cardiac Na+ current to promote
      intracellular Na+ loading, providing a potential mechanistic basis for
      the novel form of proarrhythmia seen with this macrolide antibiotic.

AB  - Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare inherited heart condition in which delayed
      repolarization of the heart following a heartbeat, increases the risk
      of episodes of Torsades de pointes (TdP, a form of irregular heartbeat
      that originates from the ventricles). These episodes may lead to palpitations,
      fainting, and sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. Episodes may
      be provoked by various stimuli, depending on the subtype of the condition.

JID - 100968551
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bergeyella zoohelcum is an aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium
      that is frequently isolated from the upper respiratory tract of dogs,
      cats and other mammals. Clinically, B. zoohelcum has been reported causing
      cellulitis, tenosynovitis, leg abscess and septicemia, which is closely
      connected with animal bites. Here we describe a case of bacteremia in
      an infective endocarditis (IE) patient caused by B. zoohelcum, in China.
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old infective endocarditis woman who had
      no history of dog bite nor other mammal exposure suffered bacteremia caused
      by B. zoohelcum. This patient, without evidence of polymicrobial infection,
      was treated with cefuroxime and had a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: B. zoolhelcum
      bacteremia is rarely reported in IE patients. Our report expands the range
      of known bacterial causes of infective endocarditis.

TI  - Renal dysplasia characterized by prominent cartilaginous metaplasia lesions
      in VACTERL association: A case report.
RN  - VACTERL association
PL  - United States
TA  - Medicine (Baltimore)
JID - 2985248R
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal dysplasia is the most important cause of end-stage renal
      disease in children. The histopathological characteristic of dysplasia
      is primitive tubules with fibromuscular disorganization. Renal dysplasia
      often includes metaplastic cartilage. Metaplastic cartilage in renal dysplasia
      has been explained as occurring secondary to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
      Additionally, renal dysplasia is observed in renal dysplasia-associated
      syndromes, which are combinations of multiple developmental malformations
      and include VACTERL association. CASE PRESENTATION: We observed the following
      multiple developmental malformations in a 108-day-old male infant during
      a nephrectomy: a nonfunctioning right kidney with VUR, hemidiaphragmatic
      eventration, a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with tetralogy of Fallot
      in the heart, cryptorchidism, and hyperdactylia. These developmental anomalies
      satisfied the diagnostic criteria for VACTERL association. A surgical
      specimen of the right nonfunctioning kidney revealed prominent cartilaginous
      metaplasia in the renal dysplasia with VUR. The densities of the ectopic
      cartilaginous lesions in this nonfunctioning kidney were extraordinarily
      high compared with other renal dysplasia cases. Giemsa banding of his
      genome produced normal results. The patient has not undergone further
      detailed genomic investigation. CONCLUSION: This case might be a novel
      type of VACTERL association, that is, renal dysplasia combined with prominent
      cartilaginous metaplasia, tetralogy of Fallot and VSD of the heart, hemidiaphragmatic
      eventration, and hyperdactylia.

      Infective Endocarditis in Children With Congenital Heart Disease.
PL  - United States
TA  - Pediatr Infect Dis J
JID - 8701858
AB  - Two children with congenital heart disease status post surgical correction
      presented with prolonged constitutional symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly and
      pancytopenia. Concern for malignancy prompted bone marrow biopsies that
      were without evidence thereof. In case 1, echocardiography identified
      a multilobulated vegetation on the conduit valve. In case 2, transthoracic,
      transesophageal and intracardiac echocardiography were performed and were
      without evidence of cardiac vegetations; however, pulmonic emboli raised
      concern for infective endocarditis. Both patients underwent surgical resection
      of the infected material and had histopathologic evidence of infective
      endocarditis. Further diagnostics identified elevated cytoplasmic antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibodies and antiproteinase 3 antibodies in addition to
      acute kidney injury with crescentic glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy.
      Serologic evidence of infection with Bartonella henselae was observed
      in both patients. These 2 cases highlight the potential multiorgan involvement
      that may confound the diagnosis of culture-negative infective endocarditis
      caused by B. henselae.

AB  - Herein we describe the case of a 1-month-old boy with acute viral myocarditis,
      who presented with two kinds of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia,
      and who was cured after medical treatment. He was brought to the emergency
      room with poor feeding due to fever. On the third day of hospitalization,
      a narrow QRS tachycardia (180-200 beats/min) was detected. Echocardiography
      showed a high echoic area at the atrial septum around the atrioventricular
      node. The patient was clinically diagnosed with acute myocarditis. The
      narrow QRS tachycardia was diagnosed as incessant junctional ectopic tachycardia.
      The patient was treated with propranolol and landiolol. The frequency
      of the tachycardia decreased, but a different narrow QRS tachycardia was
      detected on the 15th day of hospitalization on electrocardiogram (220
      beats/min), which was ascribed to atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia.
      Atenolol was effective for the tachycardia. At 2 years follow up, cardiac
      function was normal and tachycardia had not recurred.

JID - 100884139
AB  - Ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis therapy has emerged
      more recently as a management strategy for patients with intermediate
      risk pulmonary embolism and has shown promising results in clinical trials
      by early reversal of right ventricle dilation, reduced pulmonary hypertension,
      and decreased anatomic thrombus burden. This therapeutic strategy requires
      a small fraction of the systemic fibrinolytic dose and is therefore associated
      with a reduced bleeding risk. Although intracranial hemorrhage has not
      been reported in clinical trials, it is a possible complication. Here
      we report the first case of intracranial hemorrhage related to the use
      of EkoSonic Endovascular System directed thrombolysis in a patient with
      large bilateral pulmonary embolism without any identifiable bleeding risks.

AB  - Infective endocarditis still remains a dreaded illness among treating
      physicians because of the disease course, its need for meticulous antibiotic
      management, complications, and overall morbidity. Peripheral mycotic aneurysms
      are a rarely reported complication of infective endocarditis. Mycotic
      aneurysms occur in about 5%-10% of cases of infective endocarditis, and
      most of them involve the intracranial vessels. Here, we report a case
      of native valve endocarditis in a 74-year-old man caused by Kocuria rosea.
      He presented with septic shock and acute kidney injury. His illness was
      complicated by a right popliteal artery mycotic aneurysm. He was treated
      with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin. The mycotic aneurysm needed
      aneurysmectomy and anastomosis with a graft.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes a case of a successful free flap repair
      using argatroban for local intraluminal irrigation as a substitute to
      heparin in a patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. METHODS: Case
      report and review of literature. RESULTS: The patient had an uneventful
      postoperative course, and the free flap survived without complications.
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of argatroban during microvascular surgery is likely
      to be safe and simple and may be effective in preventing micro-thrombotic
      complications during microvascular surgery, and it should be considered
      as an alternative to heparinized saline for local intraluminal irrigation.

TI  - Basal subarachnoid hemorrhage by rupture of arteriovenous malformation
      at the cerebellopontine angle.

JID - 9606526
AB  - A man in his late forties had lived as a recluse for more than ten years.
      He was found dead in his room. At autopsy, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
      was detected at the base of the brain, which weighed 1333 g. The cerebellar
      tonsil was swollen. The cerebral ventricle was enlarged and filled with
      blood. A hematoma was observed in the upper part of the left side of the
      cerebellar hemisphere. The location and size of SAH in this case indicated
      that the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm (CA) had occurred; however, CA
      was not detected. A mass of blood vessels buried in the hematoma was observed
      at the left cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The vascular lesion showed round-shaped
      blood vessels as well as flat-shaped vessels with the appearance of veins,
      but with elastic fibers indicative of arteries. The lesion was considered
      to be the nidus and was 5-8 mm in size. Feeding arteries appeared to be
      from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). However, the draining
      vein and anastomotic parts of the artery and vein were not confirmed.
      Based on these histopathological features, this vascular lesion was diagnosed
      as arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A differential diagnosis between
      AVM at CPA and CA is needed in order to identify the source of non-traumatic
      SAH.

AB  - Scimitar syndrome is a rare association of congenital cardiopulmonary
      anomalies characterized by partial anomalous pulmonary venous return,
      in which an abnormal right pulmonary vein drains into the inferior vena
      cava. This case exemplifies the role of transesophageal echocardiography
      in perioperative management and surgical decision-making.

TI  - Transient cortical blindness following intracardiac repair of congenital
      heart disease in an 11-year-old boy.
PL  - India
TA  - Ann Card Anaesth
JID - 9815987
AB  - Postoperative blindness (PB) primarily involves reception and conductance
      parts of the visual pathway due to ischemia following cessation of blood
      supply, for example, retinal vascular occlusion. Although a rare cause
      of PB, cortical blindness (CB), which results from ischemia/infarction
      of visual cortex, has a poor outcome due to its mostly nonreversible nature.
      Ischemic optic neuropathy is the most common cause of PB following cardiac
      surgeries. CB following cardiac surgeries involving cardiopulmonary bypass
      has been rarely reported. Only a few of those articles reported partial
      or complete reversal of CB. We report an incidence of transient CB in
      an 11-year-old child who was operated for double chambered right ventricle
      with ventricular septal defect.

AB  - CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old man underwent redo bilateral sequential
      lung transplantation for rapidly progressive bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome that developed 3.5 years after initial transplantation. In the
      operating room, he was sedated and intubated with a dual lumen endotracheal
      tube with subsequent single right-lung ventilation and left allograft
      implantation. His pulmonary arterial pressure became elevated with reperfusion
      of the newly implanted left lung, which required initiation of cardiopulmonary
      bypass to facilitate implantation of the right lung. After implantation
      and reperfusion of the right lung, the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary
      bypass. His chest was closed and he was transferred to the thoracic intensive
      care unit. On arrival to the intensive care unit, the patient was intubated,
      sedated, and had an oxygen saturation of 92% on a fraction of inspired
      oxygen of 100%, positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O, and 20
      parts per million of inhaled nitric oxide. He had a Swan-Ganz catheter
      in the right internal jugular vein that measured a mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure of 33 mm Hg and a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 63
      mm Hg, which remained persistently elevated and prompted further diagnostic
      evaluation.
