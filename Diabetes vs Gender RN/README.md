# Diabetes vs Gender RN
This project looked into which RN terms are significant in diabetic males versus non-diabetic males as well as between diabetic females versus non-diabetic females. This project consisted of three steps: cleaning the case reports dataframe, using statistical analyses on the resulting dataframes, and creating correlation heat map outputs based on the results.

## Content
I have included the code for said 3 steps as outlined above, as well as two heatmaps comparing non-diabetic males with diabetic ones as well as comparing non-diabetic females with diabetic ones, in relation to significant RN terms.
