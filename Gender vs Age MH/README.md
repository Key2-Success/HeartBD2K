# Gender vs Age MH
This project looked into which MH terms are significant between genders among 7 age demographics: infant, child, adolescent, young adult, adult, middle-aged adult, and aged adult. This project consisted of three steps: cleaning the case reports dataframe, using statistical analyses on the resulting dataframes, and creating correlation heat map outputs based on the results.

## Content
I have included the code for said 3 steps as outlined above, as well as all heatmaps that show significant MH terms across gender in the same age demographic.
